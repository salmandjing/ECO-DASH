# ECO-DASH (Lincoln)
Carbon Footprint Calculator

This is a website that can calculate the carbon footprint of your different modes of transportation. The site makes a api call to google maps and open weather map to tell you the footprint of your travel and if it is possible to walk. The weather api's location is set to Lincoln NE so it will only display the weather there. One potential improvement will be getting the zip code from the google maps api call to allow the website to display the weather anywhere in the world.
